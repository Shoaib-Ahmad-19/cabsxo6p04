Illustrate major potential security vulnerabilities in web applications. 
Use a checklist to document the vulnerabilities and suggest basic countermeasures. 

# Major security vulnerabilities in a web application typically fall into a few well-known categories.
Here are the most critical and common ones:

1. Injection Attacks (e.g., SQL Injection)
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
4. Broken Authentication
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. Sensitive Data Exposure
8. Using Vulnerable or Outdated Components
9. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)


1. Injection Attacks (e.g., SQL Injection)

    What it is: Untrusted input is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
    Example: SQL Injection, Command Injection, LDAP Injection.
    Impact: Attackers can read, modify, or delete database data, or even execute system commands.

    Prevention:
        => Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
        => Input validation
        => ORM frameworks
        => Least-privilege database accounts

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

    What it is: Malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users.
    Types: Stored, Reflected, DOM-based
    Impact: Session hijacking, defacement, credential theft.

    Prevention:
        =>Output encoding
        =>Content Security Policy (CSP)
        =>Input validation
        =>HTTPOnly cookies

3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

    What it is: Tricks authenticated users into performing unwanted actions.
    Impact: Unauthorized transactions or account changes.

    Prevention:
        =>CSRF tokens
        =>SameSite cookie attribute
        =>Re-authentication for sensitive actions

4. Broken Authentication

    What it is: Flaws in login/session management.
    Examples:
        =>Weak passwords
        =>Session fixation
        =>No account lockout
    Impact: Account takeover.

    Prevention:
        =>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
        =>Secure session management
        =>Strong password policies

5. Broken Access Control

    What it is: Users can access resources or perform actions they shouldn't.
    Examples:
        =>Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
        =>Missing authorization checks
    Impact: Data exposure, privilege escalation.

    Prevention:
        =>Server-side access checks
        =>Role-based access control (RBAC)
        =>Deny-by-default approach

6. Security Misconfiguration

    What it is: Improperly configured servers, frameworks, or cloud services.
    Examples:
        =>Default credentials
        =>Open S3 buckets
        =>Exposed admin panels
    Impact: Unauthorized access, data leaks.

    Prevention:
        =>Harden configurations
        =>Disable unnecessary features
        =>Regular security reviews

7. Sensitive Data Exposure

    What it is: Failure to properly protect sensitive information.
    Examples:
        =>Storing passwords in plaintext
        =>No HTTPS
    Impact: Identity theft, compliance violations.

    Prevention:
        =>Use TLS (HTTPS)
        =>Encrypt data at rest
        =>Hash passwords (bcrypt/Argon2)

8. Using Vulnerable or Outdated Components

    What it is: Libraries or frameworks with known vulnerabilities.
    Impact: Attackers exploit known weaknesses.

    Prevention:
        =>Regular updates
        =>Dependency scanning tools
        =>Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

9. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

    What it is: Failing to detect or respond to attacks.
    Impact: Breaches go unnoticed.

    Prevention:
        =>Centralized logging
        =>Alerting systems
        =>Incident response plan

10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

    What it is: Server makes requests to unintended internal or external resources.
    Impact: Access to internal services, metadata endpoints.

    Prevention:
        =>Whitelisting URLs
        =>Network segmentation
        =>Disable unnecessary outbound traffic


Additional Emerging Risks :
        =>API security flaws
        =>JWT misconfigurations
        =>Business logic vulnerabilities
        =>Clickjacking
        =>Insecure file uploads
        =>Race conditions


The most dangerous vulnerabilities usually involve:

    ❌ Trusting user input
    ❌ Missing access controls
    ❌ Weak authentication
    ❌ Misconfiguration
    ❌ Outdated dependencies
